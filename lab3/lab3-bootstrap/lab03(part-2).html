      <h3 id="1">Where Does CSS Come From?</h3>
      <p> The idea of style sheets is as old as standardized general markup languages. Cascading
        Style Sheets, usually referred to as CSS, were initially proposed in 1994. This was
        during the times of the browser wars and CSS was the least consistently rendered
        language for the browsers. Opera was an early almost perfect adopter, but the W3
        Consortium were trying to create a standard with buy in from the more popular browsers
        Internet Explorer and Netscape. As CSS became standardized web browsers began to improve
        their support and today most modern browsers support CSS in a fairly consistent manner.
        The HTML5 standard has eliminated much of its design formatting features and offloaded
        that work to the CSS standard. HTML5 expects you to use CSS to make your pages look good.
        This is because HTML was always great at describing documents, but often terrible at
        making them look really great. And making webpages look great is where CSS shines.</p>
      <p>     
        CSS easily lets you build stylesheets for whole websites so you can make changes to
        your corporate identity in one place instead of having to touch every file in your website.
        If you decide to move all your website backgrounds to blue from brown, no problem! Just
        modify and publish that master style sheet CSS file and you are done.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      
      <h3 id="2">How a Style Sheet Works</h3>
      <p>The word cascade is used to describe how CSS works and here should remind you of a 
        waterfall. The water falls down and hits the various ledges until it looks a certain 
        way. Waterfalls are beautiful, so it is a fitting metaphor for making the web a beautiful
        place. 
      </p>
      <p>This idea of a waterfall effect is what Håkon Wium Lie, the inventor of CSS and chief 
        technical officer for Opera, intended for us to think about when he proposed CSS in 1994. 
        In CSS we can have many different style rules ranging from general to very specific, 
        and often it is the last, most specific rule that will take precedence over how the 
        browser will display the web page content. Think of it like this: we wash the styles 
        over the document until it looks just the way we want it too. While Håkon Lie called 
        this process of styling the webpage the cascade, others have called it the war of 
        the styles.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 id="3">Order of the Cascade</h3>        
      <p>
        Understanding the rules of the cascade are important. Often when students have 
        unexpected results from CSS it is because they do not understand how CSS decides what 
        style rule wins in a given situation. 
      </p>
      
      
        <blockquote id="block" > <strong> When two elements have the same specificity value then the declaration that comes 
        last in the source code wins.</strong></blockquote> 
      <p>
        There are three levels of priority in the evaluation of the CSS cascade: <i>Origin and
        Importance</i>, <i>Specificity of the Selector</i>, <i>Order of Appearance</i>, and 
        <i>Inheritance</i>. Each of these priority levels has different rules as to how they 
        are evaluated, but when we have a rule that clearly wins at a level then it is applied 
        to the webpage, otherwise the next level is evaluated. This is why sometimes you add 
        a style rule and it seems to make no change to your webpage, something with a greater 
        priority has applied its rule first.
